                    Women will be given training on various aspects, including group formation, skill
                    upgradation management of the primary producer groups and co-operatives, entrepreneurship skills,
                    marketing, awareness of their rights and gender concern etc. So as to equip them to face, overcome
                    and resolve their economic and social constraints and problems at their own level and to promote
                    genuine empowerment. This is the basic approach towards the evaluation of the Status of women.</p>
                <p>The implementing agency in the project formulation will outline the training arrangements of
                    the beneficiaries, extension workers, field supervisors and technical staff, etc. identifying the training
                    institute, guidelines of training, cost estimate etc. No additional training institute will be established.
                    The existing infrastructure already available will be uplifted and Training will be through accredited
                    agencies/Trainers. NIPCCD will coordinate the training arrangements and ensure that the training is
                    imparted not only in the technical trade to upgrade the skills of market management, but also in
                    gender sensitization, gender awareness, including legal literacy and sensitization.</p>

                <p>
                    Strong forward and backward linkages will be essential to ensure the viability and success of
                    the economic activities of the project in the sector. The implementing agency will help for the
                    provision of raw materials, ensure proper marketing and tie-ups for marketing of the produce’s during
                    the project period and help the groups of women under the project to manage these activities within
                    the group once the project is over. The implementing agency will help up in tying up credit facilities.
                    Rashtriya Mahila Kosh (RMK) will be included as a nodal agency for micro credit facilities. Besides,
                    other financial institutions/agencies may be considered for credit linkages of the beneficiaries
                    depending on their presence in the area. The women’s groups should not be wholly captive to
                    Governmental Corporations for marketing their products in the interest of making the groups selfsustaining in
                    their rural set up. One of the project objectives will be to ensure that these groups are
                    able to develop and thrive on a self-sustaining basis in the market place, with the minimal of
                    Governmental and formal support and intervention.

                    The implementing agency will issue Photo Identity Card to all beneficiaries for the project and a copy
                    of the same will be forwarded to the Ministry for records.
